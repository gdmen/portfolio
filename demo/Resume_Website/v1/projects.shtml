						<p><span class="content_emphasis">Resume Website (This one!)</span></p>
						<p>This site was a week-long project built as I learned (x)html, css, javascript, and Microsoft Expression Design (for the images).
						I created 100% of this site - all xhtml, css, javascript, and images!</p>
						<p>I've tested this site in Firefox, IE8, and Chrome in 1440x990 and 1024x768 screen resolutions.</p>
						<p>The most annoying challenge was figuring out the javascript to do the switches (display on/off) between content when selections are made in the sidebar.</p>
						<p>Problems to fix:</p>
						<ol><li>The side menu doesn't work at all without javascript enabled.</li>
							<li>I've had trouble making a comprehensive site map because inner pages are just divs switched with javascript.</li>
							<li>The site is pretty unusable in 800x600 screen resolution.</li>
							<li>The whole site seems heavy/overdone and too dark.</li>
						</ol>
						<p>No other implementation flaws that I'm aware of, just design issues.</p>
						<p>Overall, I'm happy with this first stab at web design. In my defense, I started with no layout plan. If I do update the layout of this site, I'll probably go for a more reasonable main menu.</p>

						<p>A 3D rubik's cube implemented in python using PyOpenGL, NumPy, and wxPython.
						You can jumble the cube and then solve it while enjoying the awesomely animated rotations!</p>
						<p>Features:</p>
						<ol><li>Move selected face (also rotates cube to maintain view of selected face)</li>
							<li>Rotate the row/column containing the selected face</li>
							<li>Jumble cube</li>
							<li>Reset Cube</li>
						</ol>
						<p>The following video contains three 'games.' The first game demonstrates selection movement, rotation, and solvability. The transition to the second game demonstrates the reset function. The second game demonstrates a single jumble and solve. The third game has multiple jumbles (for those who can solve a rubik's cube better than I can!).</p>
						<p>The screen capture program (CamStudio) significantly slowed the game, but it wasn't that fast to begin with. I think python was not made for this!</p>
						<p>The video below is playing in an opensource flash player because the player is less cluttered than youtube embeds. For significantly better quality, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEW-hNTeqeg">view here</a>.</p>

						<p>A chess game implemented in Java using the Swing toolkit/AWT. It took me about 30 hours over the course of a week.</p>
						<p>Features:</p>
						<ol><li>Highlight possible moves (toggle-able)</li>
							<li>Corny sound effects and animated gifs</li>
							<li>Taken pieces display</li>
							<li>Move notation display</li>
							<li>Undo Move</li>
						</ol>
						<p>This program prevents illegal moves and even has proper castling and en passant. My original project proposition included an AI, but it soon became apparent that would be impractical for a week long project.</p>
						<p>I wrote the GUI myself (i.e. no Netbeans) and I'm still surprised at how professional this program looks.</p>
						<p>The code and executable jar I have made available are of this project as shown in the following video, but without the images, sounds, and a few interface elements. When I wrote this, I was relatively naive about copyrights and didn't bother to properly keep track of image and sound sources (they were all free, I just can't attribute some of them).</p>
