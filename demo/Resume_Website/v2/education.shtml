						<p>"This course focuses on the issues encountered in building Internet and web systems: scalability, interoperability (of data and code), atomicity and consistency models, replication, and location of resources, services, and data. Topics include other remote procedure calls, caching, replication, and hierarchical structures; distributed consensus and transactions. Of particular focus will be techniques for locating machines, resources, and data (including ranked web search, publish/subscribe systems, directories, and peer-to-peer protocols). This course has a significant project-based component, in order to provide hands-on experience with the ideas and algorithms discussed. Students will construct and validate a large-scale distributed system, with some components developed individually and some in teams."</p>
