The following video contains three 'games.' The first game demonstrates selection movement, rotation, and solvability. The transition to the second game demonstrates the reset function. The second game demonstrates a single jumble and solve. The third game has multiple jumbles (for those who can solve a rubik's cube better than I can!).

The screen capture program (CamStudio) significantly slowed the game, but it wasn't incredibly fast to begin with.
