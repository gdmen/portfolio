----technologies----
Java, Eclipse
----summary----
Java Swing chess game for two human players. This chess game was implemented in Java using the Swing toolkit/AWT. It took me about 30 hours over the course of a week and was my final project for AP Computer Science.
----features----
1. Highlight possible moves (toggle-able)
2. Corny sound effects and animated gifs
3. Taken pieces display
4. Move notation display
5. Undo Move
----details----
This program prevents illegal moves and has proper castling and en passant. My original project proposition included an AI, but it soon became apparent that would be impractical for a week long project.

I wrote the GUI myself (i.e. no Netbeans).

The code and executable jar available for this project are as shown in the [Media](#media) section, but without the images, sounds, and a few interface elements. When I wrote this, I didn't think to properly keep track of image and sound sources (they were all free, but I can't attribute some of them).
----bugs----
* It is possible to continue a finished game by checkmating, choosing exit in the game over window, choosing no in the exit verification window, undoing a move, and continuing.
