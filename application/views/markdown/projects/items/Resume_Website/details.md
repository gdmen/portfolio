#####Version 1

This site was a week-long project built as I learned (x)html, css, JavaScript, and Microsoft Expression Design (for the images). I created 100% of the site - all xhtml, css, JavaScript, and images.
I tested this site in Firefox, IE8, and Chrome in 1440x990 and 1024x768 screen resolutions.

Since I wasn't familiar with web design, I wrote the listing pages (projects, places of employment, courses) as single pages with divs that were swapped around using JavaScript. This raised a few serious issues:

* The side menu didn't work at all without JavaScript enabled
* I didn't use anchor tags, so adding a site map was hindered by the lack of inner pages and it was impossible to share deep links. I presume that search engine indexing was similarly hindered.

The other major problem with this version was the overall look of the website. I was a newbie, easily impressed by rounded edges and dark gradients!

#####Version 2

About a year later, I updated the design of the website. The first version was heavy, dark, and a bit depressing. In this iteration, I adopted a much lighter color scheme and toned down the main menu.

I wasn't very familiar with PHP yet and didn't see a simple solution to the JavaScript problem so I left it as it was.

#####Version 3

Another year later, I finally fixed the JavaScript tabbing design mistake. I converted all pages to PHP and replaced the JavaScript menu with PHP handling using GET parameters.

I made only minor design changes - lightening the font and removing unnecessary UI complexity in the side menu.
