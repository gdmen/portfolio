This program prevents illegal moves and has proper castling and en passant. My original project proposition included an AI, but it soon became apparent that would be impractical for a week long project.

I wrote the GUI myself (i.e. no Netbeans).

The code and executable jar available for this project are as shown in the [Media](#media) section, but without the images, sounds, and a few interface elements. When I wrote this, I didn't think to properly keep track of image and sound sources (they were all free, but I can't attribute some of them).
