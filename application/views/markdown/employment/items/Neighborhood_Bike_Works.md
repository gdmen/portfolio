I helped kids in the program build and fix bikes. I am now reasonably competent at (older) bike repair.

I also helped run practices twice a week for Neighborhood Bike Works' youth racing team.

Neighborhood Bike Works "is a nonprofit educational organization in Philadelphia that seeks to increase opportunities for urban youth through bicycling and to promote cycling as an environmentally friendly means of transportation."
