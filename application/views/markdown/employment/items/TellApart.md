> Here's the feedback I promised you. I spoke with a few different members of the team that you worked closely with to put all of this together. Thanks for being patient.
>
> Strengths:
> - Pro-active about getting work to do
> I never had to worry about you not having tasks to work on. As we better understood how you work best (e.g. having multiple tasks in the air at the same time) I think this got even better.
>
> - Want to understand what you're working on, not afraid to ask questions when you don't
> I think this is one of the most consistent pieces of feedback I got when speaking to the team. You ask great questions.
>
> - Noted improvement in just getting things working
> There was a very clear distinction between pre-internship and post-internship Gary's abilities to just get things done. By the end of your internship I had confidence that you would figure out a way to handle the technical challenges of the tasks you were working on. 
>
> - Communication
> You're probably surprised to see this here. Everyone was really impressed with your final presentation, I know you put a ton of work into it, and it definitely showed. Great job.   
>
> Areas to work on 
> - Ownership
> I think you could have done a better job of owning the projects you worked on. We discussed this a couple times in our one-on-one's, but it is an area I still think you could focus on improving.  
>
> This could have been an issue with engagement, or general excitement about the projects you were working on, but we never made the transition from you being handed work/tasks to you driving the project forward and figuring the next steps to be taken on your own.
>
> You contributed a ton of great work throughout your internship, but you would have been able to do even more if we could have pointed you at a project, said "go", and known that you would figure out and take all the steps necessary to bring it to 100% completion.
>
> That's all from me, I hope it helps!
