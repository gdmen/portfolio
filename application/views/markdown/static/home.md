## Hello World,
I'm a Computer and Information Science student at the University of Pennsylvania, graduating with my Master's this December. My education lies primarily in back end software development but most of my free-time projects are web application and UI work. I'm not very good yet, but I enjoy UI design immensely!

When I'm not writing code I'm busy eating enough, lifting, and learning judo!
