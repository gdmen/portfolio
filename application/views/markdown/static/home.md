#Hello World,
I'm a $$age$$ year old [Computer and Information Science](http://www.cis.upenn.edu) student at the University of Pennsylvania, graduating with my [Master's](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/grad/gradhandbook.shtml#MSE) this December. My education lies primarily in back end software development but most of my free-time projects are web application and UI work. I'm not very good yet, but I enjoy UI design immensely!

This summer, I'll be a Software Engineering Intern at [TellApart](tellapart.com), a [behavioral retargeting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_retargeting) startup just south of San Francisco. I'm going to be working primarily with [Trevor Reid](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=100712316) to build out the data handling and UI of their in-house analytics tools.

When I'm not writing code I'm busy eating enough, [lifting](https://www.fitocracy.com/profile/gdm), and [learning judo](https://www.facebook.com/groups/27037956862)!
